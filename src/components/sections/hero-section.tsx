              But that is not the way you learned Christ!—assuming that you have
              heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus,
              to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of
              life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed
              in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created
              after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
